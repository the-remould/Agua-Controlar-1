# Agua-Controlar-1
ESP32S board is controlling the water pumps, ESP8266 board is sending the sensor data to Thingspeak. 

TO DO LIST-

1. Fix security on esp-outputs.php page

2. Buttons have turned into check boxes!? I want buttons but a little bit smaller than they were

3. Add sensor code from Soil Humidity to  Agua Controlar 1 (ESP32S board)

4. I want soil humidity data sent to Thingspeak instead of Asksensors
