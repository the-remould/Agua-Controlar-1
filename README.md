# Agua-Controlar-1
ESP32S board is controlling the water pumps, ESP8266 board is sending the sensor data to Thingspeak. 

TO DO LIST-

1. Fix security on esp-outputs.php page.

2. Buttons have turned into check boxes!? We want buttons but a little bit smaller than they were.

3. Add sensor code for Soil Humidity to  Agua Controlar 1 (ESP32S board).

4. Send soil humidity data sent to Thingspeak instead of Asksensors.
