# Agua-Controlar-1
ESP32S board is controlling the water pumps, ESP8266 board is sending the sensor data to Thingspeak. 

TO DO LIST- (in approximate order of importance)

1. Fix security on esp-outputs.php page!

2. Add sensor code for Soil Humidity to  Agua Controlar 1 (ESP32S board).

3. Send soil humidity data sent to Thingspeak not Asksensors.

4. Buttons (for relays/pumps) have turned into check boxes!? We want buttons but a little bit smaller than they were. Dashboard must be well visible on my phone in sunlight without glasses!

5. When button is pressed, it should reset after x seconds.

6. Research deep sleep mode, this will enable unit to run for several months from 3x AA or AAA batteries.

7. Look into OTA updates (wifi or Bluetooth).

8. Figure out ESP32 mail client.

9. Learn about MQTT/Mosquitto
